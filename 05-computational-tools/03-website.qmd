Having a professional online presence with a portfolio of projects showcasing your work speaks a lot louder and more convincingly of your technical abilities than any line on your resume can. 

We can relatively easily implement a website for you and your project using [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) to create html sites for both yourself and the project, and [Github pages](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html) to publish the sites.

## Personal Website

Create a Github repository named `[your-username].github.io`. Then follow the steps described under [Creating a Website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) to set up your personal website. 

Follow the instructions for [Publishing the site](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html) to use Github Pages as a webserver.
